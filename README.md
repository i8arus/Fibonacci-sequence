This is a basic JavaScript project that generates the Fibonacci sequence up to a given number of terms. The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1.

🔧 Features
Generates Fibonacci sequence up to n terms

Returns an array of Fibonacci numbers

Includes input validation

Demonstrates loop-based logic

Simple and easy-to-understand code

💡 Technologies Used
JavaScript (ES6+)

Console-based logic (no HTML/CSS required)

📘 Example Usage
javascript
Copy
Edit
fibbonachi(5); // Returns: [0, 1, 1, 2, 3]
🔍 How It Works
Starts with an initial array [0, 1]

Uses a loop to calculate each new term as the sum of the previous two

Continues until the array reaches the requested length
